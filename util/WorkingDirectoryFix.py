"""
Simple workaround that sets the current working directory to wherever Guardian.exe exists,
instead of wherever the console was launched from. Functions like open() use the working directory
as a base for any local paths specified, so if the working directory isn't as expected then files get
saved in the wrong location (e.g. on the Desktop if you launched Guardian from a console that had its'
path currently at the Desktop).
