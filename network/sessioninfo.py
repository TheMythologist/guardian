"""
Ok so now that we've finally figured out most of the bugs / problems with pickling packets we can now actually start
to curate information from packets (and perhaps even other metrics) that can be displayed. I have a couple ideas:

Filter Processing Time: The amount of time it took to process the previous packet.
Average Filter Processing Time: A cycling queue of 50 or 100 numbers, all containing the amount of time in seconds it
    took to filter each packet. Would give a good idea on the additional latency introduced by the filter.
    
Last IPC Overhead: The amount of time it took to pickle / pipe information across to the diagnostic process.
Average IPC Overhead: Cycling queue of 50 or 100 numbers, same ideology as Average Filter Processing Time.

Current Filter Load: The amount of "off-time" between filtering two different packets. I believe the calculation would
    be (filter_processing_time) / (filter_processing_time + filter_off_time). If filter_off_time is big, the filter is
    not under load and the resulting value is small. If filter_off_time is small, the filter is loaded and the resulting
    value will be much closer to 1 (or 100%).
Average Filter Load: Same as Current Filter Load, but the last 50 or 100 calculations.

Per IP:
    Packets Received:               Pretty obvious.
    Bytes Received:                 Pretty obvious.
    Packets Received per second:    Pretty obvious. Could this metric be used as a last line of defence on client tunnels?
    Bytes Received per second:      Pretty obvious.
    Last Seen / Last Packet Recv'd: Pretty obvious.
    Packets Dropped:                Pretty obvious.
    Packets Allowed:                Pretty obvious.

Tags:   Miscellaneous information about an IP. All in text format.
    VPN / Residential / TOR:    What "kind" of IP this is.
    R* OFFICIAL / R* SERVICES:  If this is used by R* for their services.
    APPROXIMATE LOCATION:       Nothing too descriptive, just the continent / nation. We don't want dox'ing.
    MODDER / STALKER / SCRAPER: There's a chance that we can tag stalkers based on network behaviour.
    WHITELISTED [TAG]:          This IP is whitelisted.
    BLACKLISTED [TAG]:          This IP is blacklisted.
    FRIEND [TAG]:               This IP belongs to a cloud-based friend.
    UNKNOWN:                    This IP has been seen but it's behaviour is unknown.
    CONNECTED / IN SESSION:     This IP is currently in the session.
    
Overall:
    Packets Received:
    Packets Dropped:
    Packets Allowed:
    Bytes Received:
    Bytes Dropped:
    Bytes Allowed:    

Meta:   Relating to the processing of Diagnostics.
    Diagnostics Queue Size:     How many packets are pending processing.
    Average Processing Time:    Average of how long it took to process the last 50 / 100 packets.
    Print Overhead:             How long it's taking to display content on the screen.
    Average Print Overhead:     Same logic as all the other averaging methods.
