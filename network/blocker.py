It appears that there is *ONE* more problem we may need to take care of which was missed during testing of the prototype.
Apparently, it's not only R* tunnels, but also client tunnels! If the circumstances are right, then it turns out that
people in your session can also tunnel players if they could not connect to you directly. Such is the joy of P2P
gaming.

This conundrum could be easily solved with packet inspection but I'm going go back on my previous words and try to
solve this by filtering some outbound packets, as it's the only solution I can think of.

My idea is that if we receive a matchmaking request (or what could be a matchmaking request), then we will temporarily
drop responses from us to any other client in the session. This, again, will have to be guessed from the payload size.
Currently, I have no idea whether the responses to matchmaking requests are unique enough to be blocked without risking
dropping other game traffic from someone who is actually in the session.

It's possible that this behaviour can be mitigated by making the whitelist filter "air-tight" as there was a bug in the
official build which was leaking packets. However, if this bug is reported significantly in testing then I'll go ahead
and develop my theoretical solution.
"""


"""
The main flaw in Guardian lied here, in the reserved IP range. I believe this is the R* / T2 IP space, right?
In the current public build, any packet from these IPs is allowed, but we can no longer do this. We have to block
tunnelled connections which may come from this IP range, while still allowing certain services like the
session heartbeat and matchmaking requests.

Currently, my proof-of-concept does not discern whether a heartbeat has come from a R* / T2 IP as I have not been able
to confirm if that actually is the case. Ideally, ipfilter should be a range of all IPs that can send heartbeats
and / or matchmaking requests, and so the checks for packet sizes will be done only if the packet has come from an IP
in the ipfilter range.

So, ipfilter's usage has been removed from the Whitelist class. I didn't completely remove it because I think it would
still be useful to compare how the new rules can drop tunnels while still letting heartbeats and matchmaking through.
"""
ipfilter = re.compile(r'^(185\.56\.6[4-7]\.\d{1,3})$')
logger = logging.getLogger('guardian')
# packetfilter = "(udp.SrcPort == 6672 or udp.DstPort == 6672) and ip"

"""
I decided to filter only on packets inbound to 6672 because most of the new filtering logic only checks inbound packets,
and I don't think it makes much sense to add extra load by checking outbound packets when we're not doing
anything interesting with them at the moment. I also found the packet payload sizes to be more consistent when coming
from R*-owned resources instead of looking at the responses to those requests.
I also believe that strictly filtering on inbound helps the game remain unaware that packets are being filtered and
this might mean that the game will probably behave in a more consistent manner.
(If the game was aware packets weren't reaching clients, it may change its' behaviour)

NOTE: If R* ever updates Online to support IPv6, then "and ip" should be removed from packetfilter,
      and parts of the filter logic (in the Whitelist class) that use the packet.ip attribute should be changed.
"""
packetfilter = "(udp.DstPort == 6672 and udp.PayloadLength > 0) and ip"

"""
Based on network observation, the payload sizes of packets which are probably some sort of heartbeat (and therefore
should be let through so the session stays online), or a matchmaking request (and therefore should be let through so we
can see who's attempting to connect to us).

Interesting note: All the matchmaker requests have payload sizes that may be 16 bytes apart.
"""
heartbeat_sizes = {12, 18}  # sets allow O(1) lookup
matchmaking_sizes = {245, 261, 277, 293}  # probably a player looking to join the session.

"""
Matchmaking response sizes might be: 45, 125, 205?
The size 45 payload definitely cannot be blocked as it pops up frequently in normal gameplay.
It appears that the 125 and 205 packets also pop up from time to time.
The first *two* packets sent to a client joining do appear to be size 125 and 205, though. Hmmm...
So the initial join response appears to be 125, 205, 45, 317, 493?

Looks like blocking 205 inbound is our best bet. 493 outbound is also a possibility but probably has a chance of
accidentally dropping the client non-tunnels.

After I wrote these comments it was discovered that Guardian wasn't filtering packets all the time. This bug has since
been fixed and hopefully will also mean these "client tunnels" are now no longer an issue. Leaving these notes in just
in case they're useful later on.

Okay, so there's a couple of changes that need to be done to fix auto-whitelisting.

The main flaw is that this IPCollector has a chance of collecting IPs that are responsible for R* Services
(and can i.e. be used for tunnelling).
When you're in a session, a R* Service will "ping" your session / check for a "heartbeat". If your session is pinged
while the IPCollector is running, the IPCollector will add the source of that ping to the whitelist.

This wasn't a problem before Online 1.54 because these services weren't used for tunneling connections. But, now, if
a player joining the session cannot connect to you directly, these IPs can be used for R* Services *can* be used for
tunnelled session traffic. As the IPCollector has added these R* Service IPs to the whitelist, tunnelled connections are
now also whitelisted, which obviously breaks session security.

The first fix is to adjust the rules / "reasons" the IPCollector may add an IP to the auto-whitelist.
Because the new filters only filter inbound traffic, I have decided to only add an IP to the auto-whitelist if:
 - the packet is inbound
 - the packet does not contain a payload size equal to a heartbeat
 - the packet does not contain a payload size equal to a matchmaking request

There is one more check we need to perform, which will be done *after* the IP collector has run, mainly due to the extra
complexity required to perform it.
My research indicates that R* uses Microsoft Azure Cloud for most of their R* Services. Microsoft frequently publishes
their IP ranges used for cloud activity. As a last safe-guarding step, we should acquire these IP ranges and ensure that
collected IPs do not correspond to any cloud traffic.

If the new version of the IPCollector has saved an IP address used by Azure, this almost certainly guarantees that
someone is already being tunnelled through a R* Service (as using Azure for VPNs is incredibly rare), and we will need
to display a warning that these players must be dropped from the session for security to remain.

There are some extra heuristics we could also add to the IPCollector, such as actually noting any IPs that might be
R* Services by checking their payload sizes, running the auto-whitelist service for a whole 60 seconds (!), and also
only adding IPs which have sent a certain threshold of packets during the IP collection phase. (When in a session, you
send a *significant* amount of packets between clients, compared to only a handful of packets for other misc. activity.)
